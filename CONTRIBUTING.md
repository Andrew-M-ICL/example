This is just an example, so will be copy/pasting various lines from examples provided by ICL. It may ultimately be nonsensical/conflicting, but deliberately includes examples of several different formatting/presentation features.

## Code of Conduct

This project has nothing to do with the [Atom Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - this is an example formatting feature. Please report unacceptable behavior to [example@email.com](mailto:example@email.com).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

Text goes here, I guess.

### Atom and Packages

Atom is a large open source project &mdash; it's made up of over [200 repositories](www.link-to-repos.github.com). When you initially consider contributing to Atom, you might be unsure about which of those 200 repositories implements the functionality you want to change or report a bug for. This section should help you with that.

Atom is intentionally very modular. Nearly every non-editor UI element you interact with comes from a package, even fundamental things like tabs and the status-bar. These packages are packages in the same way that packages in the [Atom package repository](www.exampleurl.com) are packages, with one difference: they are bundled into the [default distribution](www.link-to-download.github.com).

To get a sense for the packages that are bundled with Atom, you can go to `Settings` > `Packages` within Atom and take a look at the Core Packages section.
